# Joke Collection App

## Summary
Joke Collection is a Vue 3 application that allows users to browse, rate, and save their favorite jokes. The app features a clean UI, dynamic joke listing, and interactive features such as favoriting and rating jokes.

## Technologies Used
- **Vue 3**: Chosen for its reactivity, composition API, and efficient rendering.
- **Vite**: Ensures fast build times and an optimized development experience.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI**: Used for styling with utility-first and component-based design.
- **i18n**: Used for internationalization and toggling between English and Greek.
- **Pinia**: State management for storing and handling favorite jokes. Basically, not needed due to local storage, but anyway! ðŸ˜†
- **Vue Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching.
- **Axios**: API requests.
